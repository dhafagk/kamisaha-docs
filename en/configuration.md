### Essential Configuration

After finishing installing the Theme, the next step is to configure the Theme so that it works properly. This configuration is mandatory or you have to do it. If this is not done, the Theme will not work properly.

If you are confused or don't understand during configuration, please ask [me](#).

#### IMPORTANT NOTE

Because Kamisaha theme on single page can contain many images and also animation / jQuery. So I recommend that you use a CDN and Image Optimizer plugin to speed up website loading.

For CDN, I recommend using Cloudflare, because besides being free, Cloudflare is also easy to use.

For the Image Optimizer plugin, I recommend using the **Smush** plugin. In my opinion it's the best plus there is a Lazy Load option too, which makes website speed even more increasing.

Finally, because I didn't design the original WordPress comments, I **highly recommend** use **Disqus** because Disqus is just the best. But if you want to use original comments from WordPress, you can design your own or contact me.
